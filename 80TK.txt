* MUST TEST IF CRUBASE IS OTHER THAN >1100
* IF IT IS NOT THEN MUST TEST IF DR1 EMULATION IS ON BECAUSE IF
* IT IS THEN PHYSICAL DR1-4  BECOMES LOGICAL 2-5

       C    @DCPRES,@WDPRES   IS HFDC AT CRU >1100
       JNE  $+12              NO SO DRIVES WILL MAP OK

* OTHERWISE DRIVES WILL NOW MAP CORRECTLY
       MOVB @LODRVS-1(R1),R2  get the # of tracks for this drive
       CB   R2,@H50           is it an 80 track drive
